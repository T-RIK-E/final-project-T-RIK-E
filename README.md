#Sorting visualizer

This app is a sorting visualizer. It shows the process
of sorting algorithms step by step. The red bars are
the heights that are being compared and swapped.

In total, there are 9 working algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Comb Sort
* Counting Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Shell Sort

The radix sort is a work in progress because there
were a lot more complications and specifics with
regards to LSD, MSD, Bucket sort and the differences.

You can look through each different types of sorts,
stop them mid sort, and see the array access quantity.
##How to use

To go to a different sort, press the left and right
arrows.

To stop and array from being sorted, press the space
bar. This will stop all sorts from continuing, so
please be conscious of that.

To restart a sort, press R.

##Things to note

When go to a different array, the state of the
previous sorting algorithm WILL be preserved. The
previous sort will not be stopped, just paused until
you come back to it

Restarting the sort WILL NOT restart every array.

Stopping the sort WILL stop all sorting algorithm.
