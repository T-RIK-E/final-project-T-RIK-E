#Final project proposal
My final project will be a visualization of 
different sorting algorithms. For example, I 
would code insertion and selection sort and
visualize each step of the way. For reference
see this:

##Week one 
I will start by coding one simple sorting
algorithm, such as insertion sort, as a 
base to start. Then I will code some basic
UI components like the rectangles and colorings.
I will get the basic rectangle movement and 
coloring that reflects the sorting algorithm.
I will also make the code flexible enough to
add more algorithms

##Week two
I will add as many sorting algorithms as I can.
For now, I will use this list of sorting 
algorithms:

If this task turns out to be easier than I thought,
then I will go onto the next week a little bit.
I just assume that coding all this will take a
week. If I do have the time, I will insert
the data information.

##Week three
I will upgrade the UI to make the switching between
algorithms easily. I will add certain data 
information such as comparison amounts 
and memory access. I will also add buttons 
to start and stop the algorithm sorting process,
as certain sorts like Bogo sort may need a stop
button.
